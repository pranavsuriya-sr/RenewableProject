## üìú Project Overview

Wind energy is a significant contributor to renewable energy systems. However, wind turbines frequently encounter faults such as:
- Generator heating faults
- Mains failure faults
- Feeding faults
- Air cooling faults
- Excitation faults

These faults result in extended downtime and high repair costs, reducing efficiency and profit margins for wind farms. To address this challenge, this project focuses on **fault diagnosis** and **predictive maintenance** using data-driven techniques.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The proposed methodology consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning the dataset to remove inconsistencies.
   - Normalizing the data to ensure uniform scaling.
   - Selecting relevant features for analysis.

2. **Analysis Techniques**
   - **Statistical Analysis**: Identify trends and correlations in the data.
   - **Pattern Recognition**: Detect fault signatures and patterns.

3. **Fault Diagnosis and Predictive Maintenance**
   - Use preprocessed data to identify potential faults.
   - Predict maintenance requirements to reduce downtime.

4. **Case Study**
   - Applied the methodology to a single wind turbine to evaluate performance.
